# pytorch-tensors
# Introduction to Pytorch tensor basic operations.

Here there are some jupyter notebook (.ipynb) files that guides you through the basics of pytorch-tensors.

Anyone intrested can clone this repository and run in their local machine in the continous cycle of learning and exploring.
I have written these codes with the reference of official pytorch documentation and some tutorials.

You can find the pytorch documentation at :
https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html

  # INSTALLATION:
  
  To run these files you should install pytorch in your local environment. I suggest creating virtual environment using Anconda Navigator.
  Install anaconda navigator from https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/.
  
  Create virutal enviroment by following the given article : https://medium.com/@chinmay.s077/how-to-create-environment-in-anaconda-982ffc9f3a07
  
  After sucessfully creating the virtual environment run the following command to install pytorch :
  
  For linux OS using CPU in conda package :
  conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch
  
  
  If you have different systems then you can choose as per your requirement by visiting https://pytorch.org/.
  
  Thank you.
